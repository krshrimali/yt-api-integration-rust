# yt-api-integration-rust

This is just a repo to keep track of YouTube API integration with Rust. The goal is to get the relevant details given a YouTuber's ID.

The motivation is to use it as a crate for my app: [YouTuber Monitoring App](https://github.com/krshrimali/YouTube-Monitoring-App-Rust-Iced).

Building live on stream: https://twitch.tv/buffetcodes. YT channel might have a video coming up about this: https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali.
